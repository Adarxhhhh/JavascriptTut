 // We are learning the Arithmetic operators

 let a = 5;
 let b = 10;

 console.log("a+b = " , a+b);

 // Simnilarly for the other operators

 // +, - , * , / are your normal Arithmetic operators
 
// % is modulus -- gives you the remainder of a division

// ** is the exponentiation operator --- gives you the power of something ex: a ** b == a to the power b

// ++ increments the given variable

// -- decrements the given variable
